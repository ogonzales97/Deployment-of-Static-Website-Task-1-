    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>I used to spend hours playing <strong>RuneScape, Pokemon and Call of Duty</strong> as a child.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite memories is when I first received the <em>first ever system</em> I played games on. It was an atomic purple GameBoy Color and I loved every moment I spent pkaying on it.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>I love getting online and just researching weird but specific topics, like how <strong>computers and gaming consoles work</strong> or how onlne programs and processes we have today came about.</p>
    <p>For some reason, research and a <em>deeper understanding</em> of these topics makes me feel more accomplished and capable.</p>

    <h1>Toys</h1>

    <h2>Lego Sets</h2>
    <p>Building massive <strong>Lego castles</strong> on the living room floor was my favorite thing to do.</p>
    <p>I remember being <em>extremely proud</em> of this one lego NXT robot I built entirely from scratch as a child, even though I couldn't figure out how to program it correctly at the time.</p>

    <h2>Board Games</h2>
    <p>I used to love playing the really complex board games such as <strong>Monopoly or Mouse Trap</strong> with my family as a child. The complex set up and all of the <em>little pieces</em> that you needed to make the game work just intrigued me.</p>
    <p>Even though things have changed as I've gotten older, I still have this same love for board games in general and especially the more complex looking ones. They are all puzzles waiting to be understood and mastered.</p>
